# QuarterCarModel_NVH_Analysis
In this work, NVH analysis on the quarter-car model has been performed on two different vehicles. The data was taken from the input and the results of a previous exercise. First, the state space representation of the quarter-car model was developed. Then, it was implemented in the MATLAB® GUI Application developed in a previous exercise to obtain the frequency response of the sprung mass acceleration within a chosen interval of frequency. The output was filtered according to the ISO 2631 standard to analyze the human sensitivity to mechanical vibration. After that, the power spectral densities (PSD) of the road profile, the sprung mass acceleration, and the filtered acceleration were calculated and plotted relative to different road grades and different vehicle speed. Eventually, an optimization analysis on the damping coefficient value based on the mean squared value (MSV) of the filtered acceleration has been performed. Results show that the frequency response and the optimal damping coefficient depend only on the vehicle’s characteristics; however, the PSD and the MSV depend also on the road profile and the vehicle’s speed.
